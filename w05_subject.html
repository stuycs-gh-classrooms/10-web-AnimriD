<h2>An Introduction and History to the Sitar</h2>
<p> The sitar is an Indian Classical plucked stringed instrument. It is notably long in physical nature, with a round bottom. Most sitars come with either 6 or 7 main strings, and many more(normally 13) symphatetic strings. This brings the total amount of strings to roughly 20. Each sitarist can determine how many main and symphatetic strings they have.</p>

<p> The sitar, as implied, originates from the Indian subcontinent. It emerged during the medieval periods in India before bursting in popularitty in the 18th and 19th centuries. Scholars believe that this instrument descended from a Persian stringed instrument of similar name, and then popularized by the Mughals in India. There is dispute on the lineage of the sitar- whether or not Mughals created it or native Indians created it prior to the Mughals, deriving it from local instruments. The sitar is commonly used in performances, used for religious occassions, and for private enjoyment. It remained popular in India, especially in Bollywood movies, but is experiencing more popularity in the US due to Pandit Ravi Shankar.</p>

<h2> Why do I play the Sitar?</h2>
<p> I started playing Sitar in the winter of 2014-2015. It originally started, like many things for kids that age, with my parents urging me to try it out for a while, but then blossomed to something else. I started to enjoy playing sitar as I learned more and more from my guruji, Ustad Ikhlaq Hussain. I mostly practice, currently, in Raga Yaman and am learning to play all parts of the Raga: the Alap, Jor, Gaat, and Jaala. I have continued to play over the past 9 years, and have performed in various events. I continue to learn the sitar, and as I grow up, I practice more diligently. </p>

<h2> My History with the Sitar</h2>
<p> As mentioned, I have been learning sitar for the past 9 years. Over this course, I have performed various times and various different things. My first few performances were at my elementary and middle school's annual talent show(s). Since then, I have played sitar with the guitar with one of my friends at NYU Youth Music Festival. I have played at AMEX's Asian Network Diwali performance, as well as a fundraiser for India during COVID with the same organization. I have, most recently, performed with the Stuyvesant Beginner Band during our Spring 2023 concert. I am excited to play even more in the future, to promote Indian culture, and to promote peace and harmony throughout the world. </p>
