<h1> Why do I play the Sitar?</h1>
<p> I started playing Sitar in the winter of 2014-2015. It originally started, like many things for kids that age, with my parents urging me to try it out for a while, but then blossomed to something else. I started to enjoy playing sitar as I learned more and more from my guruji, Ustad Ikhlaq Hussain. I mostly practice, currently, in Raga Yaman and am learning to play all parts of the Raga: the Alap, Jor, Gaat, and Jaala. I have continued to play over the past 9 years, and have performed in various events. I continue to learn the sitar, and as I grow up, I practice more diligently. </p>
