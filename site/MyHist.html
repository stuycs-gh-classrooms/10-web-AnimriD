    <h1> My History with the Sitar</h1>
    <p> As mentioned, I have been learning sitar for the past 9 years. Over this course, I have performed various times and various different things. My first few performances were at my elementary and middle school's annual talent show(s). Since then, I have played sitar with the guitar with one of my friends at NYU Youth Music Festival. I have played at AMEX's Asian Network Diwali performance, as well as a fundraiser for India during COVID with the same organization. I have, most recently, performed with the Stuyvesant Beginner Band during our Spring 2023 concert. I am excited to play even more in the future, to promote Indian culture, and to promote peace and harmony throughout the world. </p>

    <p> Above are links to some of my recent performances on the sitar. I am lucky to have found two friends who play the tabla, so that they could accompany me. I am proud of my performances, including the "jam" that I had with the guitar and band. I enjoyed how we were able to combine the "Western" and Eastern/Indian cultures into a beautiful harmony. I am also proud of raising the money for UNICEF, and for the relief efforts towards India during the COVID-19 pandemic. This made me feel good as I knew that my work could benefit those who need(ed) it most.
      This history might be short, but as I grow up, I would like to continue learning the sitar and performing for others to enjoy and, as mentioned, to promote culture and peace. </p>
