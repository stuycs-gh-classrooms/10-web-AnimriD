    <h2> My History with the Sitar</h2>
    <p> As mentioned, I have been learning sitar for the past 9 years. Over this course, I have performed various times and various different things. My first few performances were at my elementary and middle school's annual talent show(s). Since then, I have played sitar with the guitar with one of my friends at NYU Youth Music Festival. I have played at AMEX's Asian Network Diwali performance, as well as a fundraiser for India during COVID with the same organization. I have, most recently, performed with the Stuyvesant Beginner Band during our Spring 2023 concert. I am excited to play even more in the future, to promote Indian culture, and to promote peace and harmony throughout the world. </p>
